===Introduction===

The use of Virtual Worlds in education is growing quickly with around three-quarters of UK universities actively using or developing in Second Life.<ref name="Virtual World Watch 1">Virtual World Watch [http://www.eduserv.org.uk/upload/foundation/sl/uksnapshot052008/final.pdf A Spring 2008 Snapshot of UK Higher and Further Education Developments in Second Life]. Eduserv Foundation, May 2008.</ref> Uses of Virtual or 'Immersive' Worlds, range from undertaking research and teaching to supporting meetings, conferences, training and providing portals to other aggregated services. Through role-play and 3D visualisation, research experiments are being undertaken in Virtual Worlds, while seminars, lectures and one-to-one consultations are supporting both local and distant learners. 

This immersive environment, provided through any one of the 100+ Virtual Worlds, is characterised by learner control, collaboration, persistence, immediacy, synchronicity, usually (not always) 3D, shareable and user-generated digital content, immersion and interactivity.<ref name="Serious Virtual Worlds 1">de Freitas, Sara [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/Home/publications/publications/seriousvirtualworldsreport.aspx Serious Virtual Worlds: A scoping study].
